# TokenShield Network - Stacks Blockchain Vault Protocol

## Overview

The **TokenShield Vault Protocol** is a secure, decentralized solution for managing digital asset vaults on the Stacks blockchain. This protocol allows users to create, store, transfer, and manage shielded assets in a trustless and secure environment. The protocol includes several advanced features like dispute resolution, staged payments, multi-signature approvals, time-lock recovery, two-factor authentication, and cryptographic verifications to ensure asset safety for high-value vaults.

## Features

- **Vault Creation**: Create vaults with specific amounts and recipients.
- **Vault Management**: Control vault transfers, cancellations, and state transitions.
- **Dispute Resolution**: Resolve disputes through arbitration, ensuring fairness.
- **Time-lock Recovery**: Secure recovery mechanism with configurable delays.
- **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**: Add an extra layer of security for high-value vaults.
- **Cryptographic Verification**: Ensure integrity and proof of transactions using cryptographic signatures.
- **Metadata Attachment**: Attach additional data to vaults such as token details and transfer proofs.
- **Extensive Error Handling**: Robust error management for secure operation.

## Installation

Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/TokenShield-Network-Staks-Vault-Protocol.git
```

Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd TokenShield-Network-Staks-Vault-Protocol
```

## Usage

1. **Deploy the Contract**: The contract is written in Clarity, the smart contract language for Stacks. Deploy it to the Stacks blockchain using a compatible Clarity environment or through Stacks-specific tools like `clarity-cli`.

2. **Create a Vault**: To create a vault, call the `create-staged-vault` function with the required parameters like recipient, token-id, amount, and number of phases.

3. **Transfer Vault Assets**: Use the `complete-vault-transfer` function to initiate the transfer of vault assets to the recipient once the conditions are met.

4. **Extend Vault Duration**: Extend the vault’s duration with the `extend-vault-duration` function, allowing for more time to complete actions.

5. **Dispute a Vault**: If there is a conflict, you can initiate a dispute using `dispute-vault`, which allows the parties involved to present their reasons.

6. **Set Backup Address**: If necessary, set a backup address for recovery in case of unforeseen events using the `set-backup-address` function.

7. **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**: Enable 2FA for high-value vaults to add an extra layer of security.

## Functions

- **create-staged-vault**: Creates a vault with a set amount, recipient, and number of phases.
- **complete-vault-transfer**: Completes the vault transfer to the recipient.
- **cancel-vault**: Allows the creator to cancel a vault.
- **extend-vault-duration**: Extend the duration of a vault for up to 10 days.
- **dispute-vault**: Dispute a vault if there is an issue with the vault’s state.
- **resolve-dispute**: Resolve a disputed vault and distribute assets accordingly.
- **enable-auth-2fa**: Enable two-factor authentication for high-value vaults.

## Advanced Features

- **Signature Verification**: Validate the authenticity of transactions with cryptographic proofs.
- **Scheduled Operations**: Schedule critical operations with delay for enhanced security.
- **Vault Metadata**: Attach metadata to vaults for detailed tracking and verification.
- **Freeze Suspicious Vault**: Freeze vaults if they are suspected of fraudulent activity.
- **Recovery Mechanism**: Implement time-locked recovery addresses for added security.

## Security

The TokenShield Vault Protocol uses a robust error-handling mechanism to ensure the integrity and safety of vaults. Each function includes strict checks and assertions to ensure only authorized actions are performed. Vaults can be frozen, disputed, or cancelled by authorized participants to protect assets in case of fraud or issues.
